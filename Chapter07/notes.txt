Tuples and lists can contain elements of different types.

Tuples are immutable. You assign elements only once and then cannot be changed.

List are mutable. You can insert and delete elements as required.

==================================================

The syntax for creating tuples is a little inconsistent.

    e.g.

    emptyTuple = ()

    singleElementTupleA = 'Groucho',
    singleElementTupleB = ('Groucho',)

    multiElementTupleA = 'Groucho', 'Chico', 'Harpo'
    multiElementTupleB = ('Groucho', 'Chico', 'Harpo')

Tuples allow assigment to multiple variables at once, called tuple unpacking.

    e.g.

    a, b, c = multiElementTupleA

You can use tuples to exchange values in a single statement without having to use temporary variables.

    e.g.

    forename = 'hingley'
    surname = 'trevor'

    forename, surname = surname, forename

Cast to a tuple using tuple().

Combine tuples using +.

Duplicate items using *.

==================================================

A list is made from zero or more elements separated by commas and surrounded by square brackets.

    e.g.

    emptyList = []
    weekndDays = ['Saturday', 'Sunday']

Cast iterable types to a list using list().

As with strings, get a single item from a list using [<offset>].

You can extract a subsequence of a list using a slice.

Add an item to the end with append().

Add an item by offset with insert().

Change an item by [<offset>].

Delete an item by Offset with del.

Delete an item by Value with remove().

Test for a value with in.

Count occurences of a Value with count(<value>).

Get the number of items with len().
