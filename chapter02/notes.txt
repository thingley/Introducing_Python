All Python data is an object!

Most data types are NOT mutable. The few data types which are mutable are;

- list
- bytearray
- set
- dict

Python is stringly typed. The type of an object does not change even if the value is mutable.

Variable names can only contain the following;

- A-Z
- a-z
- 0-9
- _

Variable names are case sensitive.

Variables must begin with a letter or underscore (not a digit).

Variables beginning with an underscore are treated specially.

Use = to assign to a variable.

In Python VARIABLES ARE JUST NAMES!!! Assignment does not copy a value, it just attaches a name to the object that contains
the data. The name is a reference to a thing rather than the thing itself.

If you want to know the type of anything use the function type(<thing>), e.g. type(7).

If you want to check whether a variable points to an object of a specific type use isinstance(<thing>, <type>), e.g. isinstance(7, int).
